# React javascript application

This is React javascript application that takes start date, end date and access token as a input from the user and takes data from https://api.giosg.com/api/reporting/v1/rooms/84e0fefa-5675-11e7-a349-00163efdd8db/chat-stats/daily/?start_date={start}&end_date={end} with HTTP get request to fetch chat counts between 'start date' and 'end date'. App needs correct 'access token' to get access to the data with HTTP get request.

After receiving data, app will output values from data fields total_conversation_count, total_user_message_count and total_visitor_message_count. App will also make paginated table that shows maximum of 5 items at the time from daily numbers, which can be found from data field by_date. Fields that are in table are conversation_count, missed_chat_count, visitors_with_conversation_count and date. User can also decide from 'chart type' menu does app output table, chart of conversation_count by date, chart of missed_chat_count by date or chart of visitors_with_conversation_count by date.

start date, end date and access token are stored in localStorage so they are already populated if user comes back to app later time.

Source code of the app can be found in file app.js and styles of the app are defined in files styles.css and input_styles.css

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
